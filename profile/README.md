### Week 47

Group Prinsessbakelse was formed and first met online to discuss and author a project proposal report. The proposal received high appraisal with confirmation of approval to advance the plan into development with the preference for human-computer interaction (HCI) survey specialisation regarding a "mindful coach" Furhat robot agent. A GitHub organisation was created for the collaborative Git development and blogging of this.

### Week 48

For Week 48, an initial development plan was established in a group meeting to implement a prototype pipeline consisting of basic features and functionality in preparation for the first public presentation scheduled on the 6th of December. The initial pipeline development plan is:
* A basic computer vision (CV) component for auto extraction of facial features from a live digital video stream
  *  Jo-Ying Tsai
  *  Sheng-Yu Wu
* A basic machine learning (ML) component for predicting high-level representations of behaviour from the CV-captured features
  * Adam Ross
* A basic FurHat Robot component for responding to mapped ML predictions of CV-captured features with socially adaptive behaviour 
  * Alan Christian
  * Shiran Sun
