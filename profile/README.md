### Week 47

Group Prinsessbakelse was formed and first met online to discuss and author a project proposal report. The proposal received high appraisal with confirmation of approval to advance the plan into development with the preference for human-computer interaction (HCI) survey specialisation regarding a "mindful coach" Furhat robot agent. A GitHub organisation was created for the collaborative Git development and blogging of this.
