### Week 48

For Week 48, group Prinsessbakelse received high appraisal for the project proposal with confirmation of approval to advance the plan into development. In a follow-up group meeting, an initial development plan was established to implement a prototype pipeline consisting of basic features and functionality in preparation for the first public presentation scheduled on the 6th of December. The initial pipeline development plan is:
* A basic computer vision (CV) component for auto extraction of facial features from a live digital video stream
  *  Jo-Ying Tsai
  *  Sheng-Yu Wu
* A basic machine learning (ML) component for predicting high-level representations of behaviour from the CV captured features
  * Adam Ross
* A basic FurHat Robot component for responding to mapped ML predictions of CV captured features with socially adaptive behaviour 
  * Alan Christian
  * Shiran Sun
